## Description
Welcome to portfolio 3.0!!  This updated version of my portfolio uses React.js to create a dynamic web site.  This application uses components and `react-router-dom` to create the various pages that showcase the various projects I’m currently working on.  React is a fantastic javascript library that brings together all of the skills I have learned over the past six months of coding bootcamp. 

## Installation
This app requires the following dependencies to be installed, `react`, & `react-router-dom`.  Once built the page is deployed on GitHub Pages.  

## Usage
Users are able to follow links to information about my skills as a web developer as well as the various projects I’m currently involved in.
